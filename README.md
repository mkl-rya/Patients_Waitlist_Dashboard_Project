# Patients_Waitlist_Dashboard_Project
I worked on analyzing a hospital patient waitlist using Power BI, and here are some key insights:

 The latest patient waitlist stands at 640K, which is a reduction from the previous average of 709K patients.
 Outpatients dominate the waitlist at 74%, with Day cases and Inpatients making up 15% and 10%, respectively.
 Patients aged 0-15 years tend to wait less, while the 65+ age group faces longer waiting times.
 In terms of specialties, Accident & Emergency leads with the longest average wait of 69.5 days, followed by Cardiology (28 days) and Medical Genetics (29 days).
